"""Notes to the employee: what it should learn at the start of its next turn
in a chat (docs-internal/chat_protocol.md, "Notes to the employee").

A note is one bracketed line, keyed per session so a newer note of the same
kind replaces an older one not yet told (``[ui-state]`` for an interface the
owner changed without pressing anything). The next run's payload claims the
session's untold notes (``claim_notes``, from ``agent.prepare_payload``) and
puts them ahead of the owner's message; the run's end marks them told
(``deliver_notes``) when it finished or stopped. A run that failed leaves
them untold, so the next turn offers them again, and a note changed after it
was claimed stays untold too.
