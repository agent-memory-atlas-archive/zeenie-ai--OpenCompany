"""What waits for the owner's OK before it goes out.

- ``contract``: the gate's contract with graphs (conditions, NO_REPLY, the
  statuses and the Undo and Restore windows).
- ``store``: the rows (models/approvals.py), moved by compare-and-swap.
- ``decisions``: the owner's send, undo, discard, restore and retry.
- ``rules``: a workflow's live Ask first rule.
- ``tool_calls``: holding a tool call that sends (``BaseNode.as_activity``).
- ``execution`` / ``activities``: sending a held call once the owner
  pressed Send (``ApprovedToolCallWorkflow``).
- ``waiter``: wakes a waiting approval gate at once.
- ``reconcile``: ends what nothing waits for any more, and restarts sends
  that never started.
- ``events`` / ``listeners``: the ``approval_lifecycle`` broadcast and who
  else hears about changes.
- ``handlers``: the WebSocket commands.

The ``approvalGate`` node that waits on a row lives in
``nodes/workflow/approval_gate``; this package never imports ``nodes/``.

Importing the package registers the WebSocket commands, the broadcast and
the cleanup that runs when a workflow is deleted.
