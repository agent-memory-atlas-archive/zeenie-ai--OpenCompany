"""The Temporal activities ``ApprovedToolCallWorkflow`` sends a held tool call
through (services/approvals/execution.py).

Both are safe to retry: a claim retried by the same workflow run finds its
own claim (the token is the run's), and an outcome is recorded once (only a
row still ``sending`` under that claim moves).
