"""The approval step's contract with the graphs and tools that use it.

An employee that asks before sending gets ``agent -> approvalGate ->
reply``: the gate holds the agent's draft until the owner presses Send or
Discard on its card. The edge into the gate skips it when the agent had
nothing to send (NO_REPLY); the edge out only fires for an approved draft.

The gate's output fails closed: ``text``, ``subject`` and ``recipient`` are
empty unless the draft was approved, so a mis-wired graph sends nothing.

A tool call that sends is held the same way (``services/approvals/
tool_calls.py``), as a row of kind ``tool_call``.
