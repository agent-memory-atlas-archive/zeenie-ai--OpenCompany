/**
 * Centralized TanStack Query configuration.
 *
 * All cache-time constants and cross-file query keys live here. Hook-local
 * keys (those consumed in a single file) stay next to their owning hook;
 * only keys read or written from more than one module are centralized.
 *
 * Query keys are built with the community-standard
 * `@lukemorales/query-key-factory` (recommended by the TanStack Query
 * docs) so key shapes, partial-match `_def` scopes, and TypeScript
 * inference are all library-managed instead of hand-rolled.
 *
 * See:
 *   docs-internal/credentials_scaling/architecture.md (cache shape)
 *   docs-internal/frontend_architecture.md            (WS-push model)
 *   https://tanstack.com/query/v5/docs/framework/react/community/lukemorales-query-key-factory
