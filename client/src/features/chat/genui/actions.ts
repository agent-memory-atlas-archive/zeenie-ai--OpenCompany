/**
 * What a reply's buttons do, as json-render action handlers. json-render
 * runs `setState` itself; every other action reaches these with its params
 * resolved against the UI's state at the press (and the press's tags,
 * genui/prepare.ts):
 *
 * - `ask` with the text the button would send. The chat sends it as the
 *   owner's message only when it is exactly what the button says; otherwise
 *   the text goes into the message box for the owner to read first
 *   (`ChatUiActions.ask` decides).
 * - Any other name goes back to the employee as a button press
 *   (`ChatUiActions.event`), the UI, element, action and params named.
 *
 * Action names are open-ended (the employee names its own), so the handlers
 * are a Proxy that answers any usable name; json-render keeps the object it
 * is given and looks names up on it.
